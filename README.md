## Setting up my windows laptop:

First you need to open up powershell as administrator and run this.

```console
wsl --install -d Ubuntu
```
and then restart your computer. 
This is going to give you a linux laptop essentially.

and then you can press Windows + r
Then type powershell and press enter
then type wsl and press enter.

Then you should get a nice place to work on stuff.
